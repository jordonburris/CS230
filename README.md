The Gaming Room is a comapny that currently has a game developed that would like us to make the game application into a web application that would be able to be played by more people.

I think I did well in writing and understanding the design constrains, as I play video games myself I feel that it was easy for me to understand what the cliet wanted out of the game.

I think the document did well on keeping me focused on the tasks at hand, I could sort of make a checklist from the document and follow the list through the code.

I think my development requirenements could have been more detailed, I feel like I could have done more research and given more information on the pros and the cons of each server and client side tools.

The users were very clear with what they wanted in the application, but they left the bigger decisions and reccomendations to the developers. It is important to understand and impliment the users needs because the application might have certain requirnemnts by the end user.

Like I stated in the other question, I like to make a checklist that I will go through and develope little by little to get to the end result of the overall application.
